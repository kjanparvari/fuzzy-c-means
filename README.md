# Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Algorithm  

An implementation of the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm from scratch in Python. This project demonstrates the use of computational intelligence techniques for clustering numeric data and was developed as part of the **Computational Intelligence course** at **Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)**.  

## Features  
- **Custom Implementation**: Built from scratch without relying on external libraries for clustering logic.  
- **Fuzzy Membership Assignment**: Each data point can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership.  
- **Dynamic Cluster Centers**: Iterative updating of cluster centers based on fuzzy membership.  
- **Visualizations**: Includes plots for clustered data and membership values.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib  

## Purpose  
This project explores fuzzy logic and clustering algorithms, providing a hands-on understanding of how fuzzy c-means operates and its applications in unsupervised learning.
